docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/test-mongo" is already in use by container "d4e620d00189c77fd302c39a2ec32b6c6f386ba85a96fb00f3194b4ff403142b". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
See 'docker run --help'.

The error message indicates that there is already a container named /test-mongo running or existing on your system. You need to stop and remove the existing container before starting a new one with the same name. Hereâ€™s how you can handle this:
Step 1: Stop and Remove Existing test-mongo Container

    Stop the existing test-mongo container:


docker stop test-mongo

Remove the existing test-mongo container:

    docker rm test-mongo

If the container is not running, you can directly remove it with:

docker rm test-mongo

Step 2: Verify Removal of the Container

    List all Docker containers (running and stopped):

    docker ps -a

    Ensure that test-mongo is not listed in the output.

Step 3: Run the MongoDB Container Again

    Run MongoDB in a Docker container:

    docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name test-mongo mongo
